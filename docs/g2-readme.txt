g2 - can be read as "go to" is a CLI-based tinyurl-like tool

USAGE:
 g2 <urlhint> [<browser_type>]

 Let's say you defined "goog" to be the urlhint for "https://www.google.com", running:
  ./g2 goog

 will open https://www.google.com/ using the default browser (defined in $default2use).
 Supported browsers can be either defined by the user or as installed in the Tool Author's 
 machine.

 urlhint supports URL Parameters. 
 
 TODO: Examples will be added later
   
CONFIGURATIONS:
 * conf/g2.conf      - lists the urlhint and actual url that can be used in g2
 * conf/g2-user.conf - user can override the browser paths for supported browsers

INVALID HINTS LOGGING:
 To support optimization of urlhints used, logging is added. It can be seen from
   logs/invalid_hints.log

 Example, in this log entries:
  [Fri, Sep 05, 2014  2:41:24 PM] - lean - 0
  [Fri, Sep 05, 2014  2:42:00 PM] - learn - 4

 It means that on Sep 5, 2 urlhints where invalid. 
  (1) lean - with 0 hints
  (2) learn - with 4 hints

 As of the moment, logs needs to be added to your system's log rotation in order to create
 a separate log file per day.
