This is intended to be a working config file for dnsmasq.

Configured as DNS only and checks first the /etc/hosts file.

Please change the following to your liking:
  * external dns to be consulted:
	   server=10.83.2.25
  * indicator for local domains
           local=/mylocal/

The rest of the configuration seems to be fine
